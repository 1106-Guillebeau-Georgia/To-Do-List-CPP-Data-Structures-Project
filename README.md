# To-Do List (C++ Data Structures Project)

## Overview: 
Console-based To-Do List implemented in C++ using array and linked list data structures to demonstrate the List Abstract Data Type (ADT). This project highlights core C++ concepts including templates, class inheritance, and dynamic memory management.

---

## Features:
- Add, remove, and view tasks through a menu-driven console interface  
- Two underlying storage models:
  - **ArrayList** — static array implementation
  - **LinkedList** — dynamic, pointer-based implementation
- Demonstrates templates, class inheritance, and interface design  
- Efficient memory management and modular code structure

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/1106-Guillebeau-Georgia/To-Do-List-CPP-Data-Structures-Project.git
```

2. Compile the program
```bash
make
```

---
## Usage:

After compiling the program, run it from the console:
```bash
./driver
```

Example Output:

## Technologies 
- C++ Programming Language
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Abstract Data Types (ADT)
- Templates and Class Inheritance
- Dynamic Memory Management (Pointers)
- Arrays and Linked List Data Structures 
- Makefile for compilation automation

---

## Notes
  - Input validation is minimal; the program assumes the user enters valid integers for menu selections.
  - Focus of this project is on implementing the List ADT using array and linked list storage, as well as analyzing the time complexity difference between them.
  - The main driver (`main.cpp`) was provided by the instructor as part of a course assignment.  
  - All data structure implementations (`LinkedList`, `ArrayList`, `Node`, etc.) were written and debugged     by me.
